Change Log for "lwm"

2009-11-20	jfc	York
	Improved performance by only checking for pending X events when the
	socket it ready for reading.

	Fixed applyGravity() bug that caused frameless windows to be
	mis-positioned.

	Applied a workaround in destroy() to avoid error reports when closing
	windows.

2005-01-28	jfc	York

	Applied a patch from Chris Reece that ensures that the popup
	menu does not disappear off the bottom of the screen.

2004-09-30	jfc	York

	Fixed an issue with IRIX 6.5 and lwm, where the root menu could
	not be used because motion events had coordinates with respect to
	the popup, not the root. Fixed by explicitly using the root window
	coordinates.

	Released lwm-1.2.1.

2004-09-28	jfc	York

	Added missing -lSM to no_xmkmf_makefile.

2003-12-09	jfc	York

	Fixed bug (reported by Matthew Wilcox) where windows with extremely
	long names could cause the pop menu to be unusable. Fixed by
	maintaining a separate, shortened name for the menu, if
	necessary ("this is a very very [...] ry long window name"). This
	takes no account of UTF-8 names as yet.

2003-12-08	jfc	York

	Fixed bug (reported by Eugene Wong) where resizing the top of
	a window would cause it to jump up several pixels. The height of
	the titlebar was not being considered when calculating mouse
	motion in reshaping_motionnotify().

	Modified manage() to avoid autoplacing windows during
	initialisation.

	Released lwm-1.2.0.

2003-12-03	jfc	York

	Applied patch from Elliott that gives focus to new windows in
	click-to-focus mode.

	Changed the buttonpress code in disp.c to ignore scroll wheel
	"clicks".

	Modified Client_Remove so that, in click-to-focus mode, it
	refocuses on the most sensible window (either the top window,
	or the window that the closing window was a transient for).

	Attempted to fix the edit placement bug by adding titleHeight()
	to the supplied X coordinate during a ConfigureRequest event,
	and not attempting to fix clients that don't supply a border
	width during a configure request.

	Fixed fullscreen-mode bug where galeon windows appeared to jump
	up and to the left after the first click.

	Released lwm-1.1.7.

2003-11-28	jfc	York

	Changed the behaviour when unhiding a window in click-to-focus mode.
	An unhidden window now automatically gets focus in this mode.

	Fixed a small bug in the session management code that could
	cause a crash when lwm quit.

	Moved a call to ewmh_set_client_list make before ewmh was
	initialised.

	Changed lwm's behaviour when minimising windows. Button three must
	now be pressed and released before the window is hidden (or
	moved to the bottom of the stack). This ensures that lwm swallows
	all the events generated during the operation, and allows the user
	to back out of the operation by moving the mouse out of the window
	before releasing the button.

	Removed include of Xm/MwmUtil.h in manage.c, and the HAVE_MOTIF
	kludge from the Imakefile, in favour of copying the few lines
	that are required from Xm/MwmUtil.h (LessTif, so hopefully no
	licensing issues).

	Fixed bug that caused the last cursor displayed in a frame
	to be incorrectly used when moving into the frame when the
	root menu was on screen. This is done by brute force -
	see Client_ResetAllCursors().

	Released lwm-1.1.6.

2003-11-26	jfc	York

	Fixed bug in Client_MakeSane that caused occasional crashes
	during window moves/resizing. Should investigate why it occasionally
	gets called with a NULL client.

2003-11-03	jfc	York

	Added an entry for LeaveNotify in the dispatch table (disp.c).

2003-08-13	jfc	York

	Removed "error" message when lwm fails to connect to a session
	manager. This isn't actually an error and the message is confusing.

2003-08-01	jfc	York

	Fixed bug that allowed clients to grab the focus and confuse lwm.

	Cleaned up the code for raising and lowering clients, and added
	code to prevent a client from being raised above its transients.

	Retired disp.old, and CLOSE_PATCH.txt.

	Added an edge resistance to the workarea, so that window may
	be moved to the edge of the workarea without precise mousing,
	as requested by MAD. EDGE_RESIST in lwm.h defines the number of
	pixels of resistance and may be safely set to zero.

	Released lwm-1.1.5.

2003-07-31	jfc	York

	In click-to-focus mode, always draw the box in the frame.

2003-07-29	jfc	York

	Added a click-to-focus mode. The default remains (sloppy)
	enter-to-focus.

	Released lwm-1.1.4.


2003-07-28	jfc	York

	Updated no_xmkmf_makefile to reflect the changes made since 1.01.

2003-07-10	jfc	York

	Fixed a bug in manage.c than prevented lwm compiling on systems
	with no variety of Motif installed. If this means you, remove
	_DHAVE_MOTIF from Imakefile.

	Released lwm-1.1.3.

2003-07-08	jfc	York

	Added support for NET_MOVERESIZE, but I cannot find any
	applications the want to use it, apart from the keyboard
	variants. I don't know what to do about the keyboard move/resize.

2003-07-03	jfc	York

	Fixed a few buglets thrown up by running lwm through the compiler
	with all warnings on.

2003-07-02	jfc	York

	In Client_MakeSane(), added a check to prevent windows being
	moved into a position where they might be completely obscured
	by panels/docks.

	Changed ewmh_set_strut() to run Client_MakeSane() across all
	clients when the work area changes. This avoids clients getting
	lost behind panels/docks.

	Added support for _NET_WM_STATE_ABOVE and
	_NET_WM_STATE_BELOW. Added fix_stack() to maintain the window
	stack as dictated by the EWMH spec.

2003-07-01	jfc	York

	Added support for _NET_WM_STRUT. lwm now maintains _NET_WORKAREA
	correctly, and takes the reserved space into account in its
	window placing algorithm.

	Released lwm-1.1.2.

2003-06-30	jfc	York

	Fixed bug that caused tk menus to be badly placed placed by
	sending a configure notify where appropriate in setactive().

	Removed compile time option of prepending window title's with
	the client machines's name (PREPEND_CLIENT_MACHINE).

	Added i18n support for window titles, using UTF8 names from
	_NET_WM_NAME where available and supported (ie XFree86).

	Added code in disp.c to change the pointer in some areas of the
	frame to indicate the action taken by button1. I didn't allow the
	"move" pointer in the titlebar because it looked nasty. Added
	the xkill pointer for the the box. This was a TODO item.

2003-06-28	jfc	York

	Added GPL headers to all the source files.

	Released lwm-1.1.1.

2003-06-27	jfc	York

	Fixed the bug where each GTK window generated an extra
	window when lwm shut down by unmapping all the clients in
	Client_FreeAll(). Elliott thinks this is bad magic, and that
	the X server should lose the windows, but this doesn't happen
	with XFree86.

	Fixed bug, reported by Ed Porter, that caused moving the mouse
	wheel to generate xterms. Wheel mice generate button press events
	on buttons 4 and 5 and shell() wasn't taking this into account.

	Fixed silly bug in motifWouldDecorate(): windows should have a
	frame is MWM_DECOR_ALL is set.

2003-06-26	jfc	York

	Shaped windows now work again. I'm not sure what I changed
	to break it, but the fix was to process shaped windows in
	scanWindowTree (they were previously ignored). They had to be
	clients anyway, if they were to appear in _NET_CLIENT_LIST.

2003-06-25	jfc	York

	Fixed bug that caused frameless windows to be immoveable.

	In manage.c, allowed lwm to fall back on Motif hints when
	deciding if a window should have a frame, if _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE
	is not set. This breaks the EWMH spec, in that a window
	without _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE should be assumed to have
	_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_NORMAL, but it's the only way for older
	apps to indicate that they don't want decorating, and in the
	absence of Motif hints the default state is
	_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_NORMAL.

2003-06-24	jfc	York

	Fixed the following TODO item:
		allow users to back out of closing a window if
		they leave the box before letting go of the button.
	Implemented by adding an extra wm_closing_window mode rather
	than adding to the Client structure, as per AMidthune's
	patch. Not sure which is the better solution, though.

	Added initial support for _NET_WM_STATE, but only for
	_NET_WM_STATE_SKIP_TASKBAR, _NET_WM_STATE_SKIP_PAGER and
	_NET_WM_HIDDEN.

	Added simple hardwired _NET_WM_ALLOWED_ACTIONS support, and
	support for the _NET_CLOSE_WINDOW client message.

	First attempt an _WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN and a full-screen mode.
	It's not quite right yet, but useable.


2003-06-23	jfc	York

	Fixed some silly bugs in the session management code.

	Added initial EWMH code using the 1.2 spec:
	http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/wm-spec/1.2/html/
	Initial support covers the mechanisms for announcing support
	for EWMH (_NET_SUPPORTED, _NET_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK), the
	client list and active client (_NET_CLIENT_LIST and
	_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW), and the window type (_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE).
	Windows may now be frameless if their window type indicates.

2003-06-21	jfc	York

	Added session management so that GNOME2's gnome-session does
	not wait a long timeout when starting the window manager.

2000-02-08	enh	Basel
	
	Tried out a patch from Robert Bauer so that it's possible to move
	windows with button 1, if you're in the ``titlebar'' (i.e. not touching
	the top border). This makes it easier for Windows users to cope
	with lwm, and easier for those with two-button mice (or laptops)
	too. At the moment, "mv disp.old disp.c" will give back the old
	behaviour.

1999-11-11	enh	Basel

	Fixed a cut-and-paste bug in client.c that made the check for
	a window being too large or too small wrong. This bug was found
	by Mike Meyer.

1999-09-22	enh	Basel

	Altered the button-press code so that it's now easier for unhappy
	users to alter which button performs which function. Simply edit
	lwm.h and modify the three relevant #define statements.

1999-07-19	enh	Basel

	Added a handler for circulation events so that other programs
	can offer "Alt-Tab" functionality.

1999-07-08	enh	Basel

	Fixed the cosmetic problem with titlebars of dialogue boxes. If
	this looks to be OK, I can think about another lwm release.

1999-06-10	enh	Basel

	Incorporated bug fix by Adrian Colley regarding the attempt in
	manage.c to call XSetWindowBorderWidth on an InputOnly window,
	and moved the #include of <signal.h> after <sys/types.h> so that
	lwm can compile on Solaris 2.6. Cosmetic change to move the close
	box to line up with the client window. The effect is spoilt if the
	child insists on drawing a black border around itself, though.

1999-02-07	enh	Basel
	
	Title-bars no longer pop up and down. An inactive window has a
	grey title instead. This means less load on the server, no annoying
	"I want to type the information from one window's title-bar into
	the current window but can't" syndrome, and a final solution to
	the race condition that's been with us since the very beginning.
	
	The size feedback no longer pops up as soon as you grab a window,
	because that made it almost impossible to grab a window without
	resizing it.

1998-11-03	enh	Basel

	The size feedback now pops up as soon as you grab a window,
	rather than waiting for you to actually move.

1998-10-06	enh	Basel

	Al pointed out that my Sun actually has two framebuffers. One
	monitor-lugging later, and I suddenly have a need for a window
	manager that can cope with multiple screens. And here it is!

1998-05-29	enh	Basel

	Fixed window minimum/maximum height code so that it no longer
	includes the title decoration. Menu now pops down if a window
	disappears while the menu is up.

1998-03-23	enh	Basel

	Removed unused constant. A little tidying up, renaming.  Some
	debugging code removed. The width of the size-feedback window
	is now calculated at run-time depending on the size of the screen.

1998-02-05	enh	Basel

	Fixed bug found by Marty Olevitch: lwm's automatic window
	placement heuristics broke down when either the right or bottom
	of the display were reached.
	Changed menu placement to ensure that the menu is fully
	on-screen.

1998-01-06	enh	Basel

	Fixed bug found by J. Han whereby lwm dumped core if a window
	disappeared while being reshaped.

1997-09-01	enh	Basel

	"Push to back" functionality moved from button 3 click in box
	to button 3 click anywhere in frame with Shift held down.

1997-08-29	enh	Basel

	Simple version numbering introduced.

1997-08-25	enh	Basel

	Fixed stupid mistake introduced with the last change, with regard
	to setting the input focus.

1997-08-22	enh	Basel

	Xt applications (strictly, applications whose window title is
	the same as their class hint resource name) no longer have a
	title bar. This means it's more awkward to kill them, but that
	they don't have pointless decoration.

1997-08-07	enh	Basel

	Bug related to hiding windows fixed.

1997-08-06	enh	Basel

	The size indictor now has the correct GC settings. Whoops!
	Improved handling of WM_NORMAL_HINTS. Amongst other things,
	this means that size reporting of xterm et al is more reliable.

1997-07-31	enh	Basel

	Reshaping now uses the popup to display the current width and
	height of the window being reshaped (in whatever units it uses).

1997-07-04	enh	Swanwick

	Clicking button 3 on the "box" pushes the window to the bottom.
	Changing image in xv no longer causes the window to gravitate to
	the southeast. There's an ICCCM convention that clients should
	set the border width with each ConfigureWindow request. As usual,
	many clients fail to follow this convention. I get the distinct
	impression that the very reason for the existance of the Xt
	library is because the X11 protocol and ICCCM are so messy and
	involved that the only way to make X11 bearable was to write
	this code once and for all. The menu code has been rewritten,
	changing as a side-effect the order in which hidden windows
	appear on the menu. The rewrite now means that the order is very
	easy to change for experiments like alphabetical ordering etc. I
	like it as it is: a stack.

1997-06-24	enh	York

	Now handles NoExpose events. Better protocol error reporting.
	Default minimum size calculation improved.

1997-06-23	enh	York

	Both button 1 and 2 can now have commands associated with them.
	See the documentation for details. Windows whose minimum and
	maximum sizes are identical can no longer be resized. The
	oscillation race condition is now less likely to occur. Some
	dead code removed.

1997-05-25	enh	York

	lwm now does the right thing with respect to hidden windows on
	exit and startup. a hidden window is now re-hidden if lwm exits
	and is then restarted.

1997-05-21	enh	York

	Fixed a bug that meant a client could confuse lwm by remapping
	a hidden window: the menu of hidden windows wasn't being updated.

1997-05-16	enh	York

	A bug relating to ConfigureRequests on the current window caused
	the title-bar to be redrawn incorrectly. Once again, this came
	to light with xv.

	The "New Shell" command has gone from the button 3 menu, and
	button 2 now performs this function.

1997-05-09	enh	York

	This version fixes a bug relating to ConfigureRequests. Client
	windows that were resized under program control were resized,
	but the client was misinformed as to what change had actually
	taken place. xv's optimised redraw, for example, missed out on
	part of the window because of this.
	The behaviour with regard to hidden windows on exit has also
	changed. They're now remapped, but lowered in the window stack.
	This means that you don't lose them, but that they don't
	obliterate the more important windows on your screen if you kill
	the window manager.
