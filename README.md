# Terminator, Evergreen, lwm and friends
 
[Terminator](https://github.com/software-jessies-org/jessies/wiki/Terminator) is a cross-platform GPL terminal emulator with advanced features not yet found elsewhere.

[Evergreen](https://github.com/software-jessies-org/jessies/wiki/Evergreen) is a cross-platform GPL development environment that tries to be lightweight and language-agnostic yet functional.

lwm, the Lightweight Window Manager for the X Window System, provides enough features to allow the user to manage their windows, and no more.

These projects were formerly hosted at http://software.jessies.org/, then at https://code.google.com/archive/p/jessies/.
