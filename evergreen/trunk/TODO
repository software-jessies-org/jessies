UI

+ Pop-up menu on title bars? Handy place to put an option to "Copy File Location", and maybe "Open Terminal Here".

+ re: "Open Terminal Here", here's how to find what we should be calling on Linux:

  lithium:~$ gconftool-2 --get /desktop/gnome/applications/terminal/exec
  /home/elliotth/Projects/terminator/bin/terminator
  lithium:~$ gconftool-2 --get /desktop/gnome/applications/terminal/exec_arg
  -e

  (sadly, update-alternatives(1) and x-terminal-emulator(1) is a completely separate mechanism.)
  
  what to do about --working-directory? (Terminator should support "--working-directory=/tmp" as well as "--working-directory /tmp", like gnome-terminal.) we could start anything else in the relevant directory; that should get xterm(1).

+ Don't show repository root prefix in title bars?

+ Intelligently truncate titles too long for the title bar?

+ Keyboard equivalent for "File Properties" (other than alt f p on Linux/Windows, which is probably good enough).

+ Add a menu item to sort a column's windows alphabetically. Would need a keyboard equivalent to see any use, I think.

+ Make it possible to reorder windows, maybe with some kind of draggable widget at the left-hand edge.

+ Fix the fact that you can slide windows off the bottom of the column, or behind the others at the bottom of a column. (this was fixed recently, but at the cost of making it really hard to scrunch a group of windows against the top or bottom.)

+ We've removed most uses of "new File" in favor of FileUtilities.fileFromString, but should probably have something similar in the other direction, where special JFilenameField components would let us always show the user-friendly forms.

+ acme used to support an arbitrary number of columns. I never really saw the use for that at the time, but now the combination of 30" displays all round and an 80-column limit on code at work means I could probably make use of two (or maybe three) columns of code. I don't know it wouldn't be confusing, though. Why don't I just have a tall but narrow Evergreen window? Because I have a lot of workspaces, and wrapped tabs are unusable. (And I'd be able to open 2 or 3 times as many windows if I had 2 or 3 columns.)


HELP/DOCUMENTATION

+ good documentation:
  http://manual.macromates.com/en/shell_commands#shell_commands
  http://projects.serenity.de/textmate/tutorials/basics/
  http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/usr_29.html#29.1 (Vim's tags support)

+ consider using WebKit to offer a native documentation browser, when WebKitGtk's far enough along to be packaged. (forget MozEmbed; it's a mess.)

+ add some way of getting a list of the documentation providers, and where they're looking, and whether they've disabled themselves for lack of data, and how you (the user) would fix that (for systems where we can't make our package install the extras automatically).

+ use CSS to improve TABLE appearance. (see STL documentation.)

+ set always on top? (an OpenWindows-like pin icon would be nice for this.)

+ documentation browser back button should have Firefox-like history pop-down.

+ documentation browser progress bar.

+ documentation browser's title should change depending on the page we're showing, putting the specific first, like Firefox: "isdigit(3) - Evergreen Documentation Browser". 

+ Insert Missing #includes (control-#)

  automatic pulling of #include files from man page for function at cursor:

   helium:/$ man 2 kill 2> /dev/null | grep '#include' | sort | uniq 
       #include <signal.h>
       #include <sys/types.h>

  avoid pulling in #includes from EXAMPLES or whatever (see strftime for such
  a man page). that is: only accept matches in the SYNOPSIS section.

  could also do import statements for Java.

+ in JavaDoc.urlExists, cache successes.

+ also Mac documentation:
   root at: /Developer/ADC Reference Library/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/
   under there: (Foundation|ApplicationKit|WebKit)/ObjC_classic/Classes/$word.html
   also: (Foundation|ApplicationKit|WebKit)/Classes/$word_Class/index.html 

+ better assembler documentation. Mac OS has "EM64T Help.app", "IA32 Help.app", and "PowerPC Help.app", which are basically just the Intel/Motorola PDFs with a machine-readable index and a little browser. we could make use of these on Mac OS or, better still, roll our own. likewise JVM bytecodes from the Sun JVM specification. one interesting problem is recognizing what kind of assembler we're dealing with.

+ also Perl documentation: use perldoc(1) for packages as well as functions. man page researcher should include "3pm" man pages in Perl context.

+ should JavaDoc link to real pages in a real web browser, or try to extract the relevant chunk? (i don't think Swing's HTML code is up to the job of showing full JavaDoc pages.)

+ Java: a visual distinction between methods from this interface and methods from superinterfaces would be useful.

+ Java: we should get rid of my compressed rendering of signatures now we've got more room. it could be quite useful to be able to copy & paste the signatures into code.


EXTERNAL TOOLS

+ ExternalTools should also let you specify which languages they apply to. 

+ automatically check for keyboard equivalent collisions (both between multiple ExternalTools and between an ExternalTool and the main application itself). one potential soft failure mode would be to allow it and simply pop up a menu if you use a duplicated keystroke.

+ add syntax for arbitrary modifier+key combinations (alt-f2, for example).

+ need a UI.

+ render stderr differently from stdout?

+ a tool that produces too much output can cause trouble. Pike's sam (and acme?) would redirect a command's output to a file, then show the first n lines of that file, giving you the option to see more. maybe we shouldn't auto-scroll? maybe we should block until the user hits a key, sort of permanent 'pager' mode? maybe we need a second level of buffering over the current get-a-line-or-a-few-hundred-milliseconds-worth scheme, so that if we don't get a natural break, we wait until we do. what i think i mean is that getting a newline shouldn't flush. we should get (say) 16KiB or timeout. only in these cases should we flush.



PREFERENCES

+ default encoding, default line ending (per language/per workspace?).

+ overriding of environment variables?

+ setting of regular expressions for excluded files, et cetera. text label explaining about the scripts we'll try to call to provide further customization.

+ we handle site-wide customization reasonably well with the "echo" scripts (though that doesn't cover everything you can set in evergreen.properties, the idea could obviously be extended). we don't handle per-language customization well (it's pretty ad hoc). these scripts are called with the project root directory as an implicit argument, but that doesn't facilitate project-wide customization.



SAVING/RESTORING STATE

+ automatically save state more frequently. (currently it's just on certain important actions: quit and new/edit/close workspace.)


MODELINES

+ parse emacs/vim modelines.

+ the indentation guesser should look for "indent" modelines. it should also cope better with "4-spaces but use leading tabs where possible".

+ support this Emacs mechanism for letting an individual source file record how to build itself? is there an equivalent for how to run/test the program?

/*
Local Variables:
compile-command: "gcc -DSOMETHING -I../include -g -Wall test.cpp"
End:
*/

+ support this BBEdit mechanism for arbitrary counterparts? handy for generated files or for linking a Java class to the .cpp file implementing its native methods.

  -*- x-counterpart: file; -*-

+ support #line?


OPENING

+ it would be nice to be able to open "~/wlog-lad.txt" more conveniently.

+ it would be super-nice to be able to browse the file system at least as well as from Windows' "Run..." dialog.

+ if we don't find an exact match (i.e. a longest common prefix that equals a workspace root), we could automatically create a new workspace with [what? the longest common prefix?] as its root". the trouble, as i've mentioned before, is that this doesn't do exactly what you want if you open an unspecific file (~/evergreen.properties, say) and then go to a more-specific file for which there's no better workspace (~/Projects/rarely-used-project/, say).

+ refuse to open another file on a workspace if it's full (there's no vertical space for another ETextWindow in the column)?

+ Keep track of 'recent files' on a per-workspace basis.

+ Offer a list of modified files too, since they're likely to be the true working set.

+ Subversion ignores the following by default; maybe we should support more than just pure extensions? And add these to our defaults?

  # global-ignores = *.o *.lo *.la #*# .*.rej *.rej .*~ *~ .#* .DS_Store
  
+ Ideally, we'd recognize the SCM system in use, and ask it what it's ignoring, and incorporate that into our indexing filter.



SAVING

+ auto-save to ".bak", on timer.

+ Vim keeps a ~/.vim/backup/ directory, containing the equivalent of our .bak files.

+ if the encoding is changed, we should check that the document can still be encoded; and prevent entering unencodable characters? ... maybe the right decision is to check on save instead. SubEtherEdit has a little dialog showing the problems:

  http://codingmonkeys.de/blog/articles/2006/09/19/new-features-in-subethaedit-2-5



SELECTION

+ Edit > Select > Word (ctrl-W) / Line (shift-command-L) / Paragraph / Enclosing Brackets (shift-command-B) / Current Scope (ctrl-alt-B) / All (command-A) 



VIEW

+ Show Line Numbers - should probably apply to the whole editor, and persist. (alt-command-L) 

+ Show Invisibles (alt-command-I) could show newlines and spaces. tabs we already show anyway.

+ Kate, BBEdit, SubEthaEdit, and others are all implementing the "indent wrapped lines" idea we never got round to.



EDITING

+ Text > Convert > to Uppercase (ctrl-U) / to Lowercase (ctrl-shift-U) / to Titlecase (ctrl-alt-U) / to Opposite Case (ctrl-G). work on selection or word at caret? or just character before caret? 

+ Text > Convert > Spaces to Tabs / Tabs to Spaces

+ Text > Shift Left (command-[) / Shift Right (command-]) add or remove one level of indentation

+ Text > Execute Line Inserting Result (control-R; actually inserts '\n' first) / Filter Through Command... (alt-command-R) 

+ Evaluate Line / Selection (control-command-C), evaluate mathematical expression; could do arbitrary Java/Ruby.

+ reformat javadoc-style comments automatically, making sure they're no more than 72 characters wide and have *s in the right places and so forth. or at least a manual way to say "do the equivalent of |fmt after removing the ASCII art, and then add the ASCII art back".

+ Handle out-of-date files better: If we kept a copy of the file's contents last time we knew we were clean, we could also provide diffs to the common ancestor. Experience merging changes with BitKeeper shows that this isn't often useful but it's sometimes very useful. If we had that, we could notice that the file on disk was touched but its contents didn't change. This would help avoid spurious out-of-date watermarks. (Keeping the MD5, like the tags panel does, would suffice.)

+ the current removal of trailing whitespace on save is okay, but has a couple of problems. firstly, it can cause an annoying scroll bar jump if the file changes too much. secondly, it means you're accidentally affecting lines you haven't otherwise touched, which may or may not be your intention.



NAVIGATION

+ Navigation > Add/Remove Bookmark (toggle on F2) / Next Bookmark (ctrl-F2) / Previous Bookmark (ctrl-shift-F2) --- handy for getting back to where you were if you need to go off and search for something.

+ A way to make caseChangesLikeThis count as word breaks. (Xcode 1.5 does this with control + arrow keys.)

+ Make the arrow keys move through 4-space tabs?

+ If backspace knows about indent.string, shouldn't delete?



SEARCH

+ use PatternSyntaxException's stored index to highlight regular expression errors in the text field showing them. JTextField does support highlighters.



FIND/REPLACE

+ Find/Replace is broken for matches that span lines. (Try a find pattern that contains "\n", for example.) [there's also a file "find-test.txt".] Martin just successfully deleted whole lines matching " *MONK\n", although the Matches and Replacements boxes were empty. The problem being that we use the Pattern.MULTILINE flag; " *MONK$" would have looked right and worked. But this isn't generally true: "a\nb" is not the same as "a$b".

+ Some way of marking submatch groups: the whole match is marked in red or blue, but it would be good to also see the submatches within that.

+ Should be able to select matches/replacements, and only apply the selected ones.



LANGUAGE-SPECIFIC COLORING/INDENTATION

+ see if we can learn anything from /usr/share/gtksourceview-1.0/language-specs

+ it would be good if users could add indenters/stylers for their own languages without having to go via us.

+ should color regular expression literals, heredocs, and (same thing) Python multi-line comments.

+ textmate uses (http://macromates.com/svn/Bundles/trunk/Bundles/Perl.tmbundle/Syntaxes/Perl.plist) this for heredocs in Perl:
   <string>((&lt;&lt;) *"([^"]*)").*\n?</string>
   <string>(^\3$)</string>

+ textmate has these test cases:

$sql .= <<SQL if ( $type eq 'cnd' or $type eq 'mul' );
LEFT JOIN features AS d6 ON a.Style = d6.UID
SQL

$Q->{foo1} ||= $DBH->prepare(<<EOQ);
pretend this is SQL
EOQ

$Q->{foo2} ||= $DBH->prepare(<<EOQ);
The next heredoc
EOQ

+ textmate also has warnings for anyone trying to do Ruby.

+ need coloring and indentation for:
  + CSS
  + PL/SQL

+ need indentation support for:
  + assembler
  + HTML (i.e. XML)
  + makefile
  + perl (currently uses C-family support)
  + vhdl
  + XML

+ kate uses (http://developer.kde.org/documentation/library/cvs-api/kdelibs-apidocs/kate/html/classKateVarIndent.html):

- var-indent-indent-after: a regular expression pattern, if the first line with content above the current, indentation is added 
- var-indent-indent: a regular expression pattern, if the current line matches indent is added. this is not tested if the above matched. 
- var-indent-unindent: a regular expression pattern, if it matches the current line, indent is removed. 
- var-indent-triggerchars: a string of characters, when any is typed, the current line is reindented. 

 bash:
  var-indent-indent-after (\\{(?![^\\}]*\\})|\b(then|elif|else)\b(?!.+fi)\\bdo\b(?!.+done)|\\bcase\\s+\\s+in\\b(?!.*esac)|\\[\\[)
  var-indent-indent \\$\\{.*\\}
  var-indent-unindent (\\}|\\b(fi|elif|else)\\b|\\bdone\b|\\besac\\b|\\]\\])
  var-indent-triggerchars {}
 perl:
  var-indent-indent-after (?:\\{(?![^}]*\\})|\\((?![^\)]*\\)))
  var-indent-indent (?:\\{.*\\}|\\(.*\\))
  var-indent-unindent [})]
  var-indent-triggerchars })
 ruby:
  var-indent-indent-after ^( )*(if|while|def|class|for).*|\\{[^\\}]*$|else|elsif|rescue|do|begin
  var-indent-indent
  var-indent-unindent end|else|elsif|rescue|^[^\\{]*\\}
  var-indent-triggerchars }def



LANGUAGE-SPECIFIC TOOLS 

+ HTML: send to validator.w3.org/check (control-command-V); also CSS validator.

+ Perl: perltidy(1).

+ C: support indent(1) if we see a ".indent.pro" file in one of the looked-for places. (or in the workspace root?) just offer to run indent(1)? or run it automatically? (on save? show a patch or just make the change, like for terminal newlines?)

+ Java: rewriting the indenter stuff, i could really have used a simple tool to show me the inheritance hierarchy of the indenter classes.

+ for reference: GEdit plug-ins.

+ offer to make #! files executable if they're not? "chmod a+x" tool?


AUTO COMPLETION

+ need to make auto-completion useful enough that it actually sees some use. maybe attack prose first, since that doesn't require type information? or is the trouble there that people don't necessarily know the prefix? i.e. i might want help with "rhythm", but it's the first 'h' i have trouble with. in which case, i'm better off misspelling and asking the spelling checker for corrections. if that's the common case, prose would be better served by a "show auto-corrections for previous misspelling" action. though we'd need a snappier name.

+ auto-completion should work for languages other than Java. We can collect all the identifiers from the current file and sort them, at the very least.



UNDO

+ why do we sometimes claim the document is dirty, yet revert says "no non-whitespace changes"?



STRANGE FILE SUPPORT

+ we could automatically gunzip/gzip .gz files.

+ we could automatically convert binary plist files to/from xml.

+ we could have some kind of helper program to help us handle authentication to read/write files we wouldn't otherwise have access to.



OS INTEGRATION

+ more GNOME icons: as well as the menu icons, we should have the same icon for the "OK" button in the corresponding dialogs.

+ we should be a top-level drag and drop target:

   http://weblogs.java.net/blog/shan_man/archive/2006/09/toplevel_drop_w.html

+ avoid GNOME focus-stealing-prevention. currently breaks command-line "Evergreen" use, auto-completion, and probably other stuff.

+ for reference: Visual Studio key bindings: http://xona.com/2005/08/02a.html



BUILDING

+ neilb suggests having the whole command in the "Set Build Target" dialog. defaulting to what we normally construct. empty string automatically replaced? or a "reset to default" button? alternatively, others have suggested adding a field that specifies a build host, and build commands are then prefixed with "ssh build-host ".

+ maybe all in a Workspace > Properties dialog, along with the title and directory (currently in "Edit Workspace")?




SCM

+ add current file ("svn add"). Better left to another tool?

+ remove current file ("svn rm").

+ remove current file ("svn revert", distinct from existing "Revert to Saved").

+ rename current file ("svn mv").

+ copy current file ("svn cp").

+ make current file editable ("p4 edit").

+ document that many SCM operations are easily and conveniently implemented as ExternalTools, and wouldn't obviously benefit from more support (other than that we could automatically paper over some of the superficial differences between the systems).



SPELLING CHECKER

+ add a way to show a short list of the misspelled words in the current file. and a way to add them to an exclusion list? or find/replace them?

+ should we be less eager? have a timer so we don't literally check as you type each character? i think what i'd really like is two visual representations: one for misspelling-in-progress that's significantly less attention-grabbing than finished-misspelling (which can be the same as what we're using at the moment), or some kind of scheme where weight increases with age? (to what extent does this compete with the desire to show you errors early?)
