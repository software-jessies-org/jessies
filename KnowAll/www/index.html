<h1>KnowAll</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I've been writing this program for years. Or rather, I've been trying out
various implementations of this idea for years. And so have other people; it's
a popular idea.

<p>As computers get faster, more searching is done automatically. Mac OS X
hardly ever requires you to ask for a search to be performed: searches happen
as you type. Although Adobe can't manage any kind of usable searching of PDF
documents, Apple made sure that their
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/preview/">Preview</a>
is fast enough to work as you type. If
you haven't tried it, you should: it's an eye-opener. Likewise, iTunes filters
the list of tracks as you type in its search field.
So does <a href="http://www.apple.com/ical/">iCal</a>. Why wait?

<p>My editor, Edit, even does regular expression searching as you type,
highlighting all the matches in the document. And it works fine on even
the most tasteless of multi-thousand line source files. (In an even more
concerted attempt to make some use of the large amounts of spare
processing power we have available while not compiling, Edit alpha-blends
the match highlights in. Welcome to the future, where everything is free.)

<p>Everybody's favorite way of searching (<a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>, silly!) remains kind of old-fashioned.
You open a new web browser window, type or paste a search
string, and hit Return. And yet it's still my search method of choice, and
probably yours too, despite various kinds of competition. I believe the reason
for this is because it doesn't require you to think about what you want, or
what you're doing. KnowAll is an attempt to take these ideas &ndash; automatic
search and "do everything I could have meant" &ndash; a step further.

<h2>Kinds of Search</h2>

<p>My first implementation of this kind of idea was in Edit. Edit supports
plug-ins called Researchers that have the currently-selected or just-typed
text sent to them whenever the user pauses. Relatively few Researchers were
written, varying in usefulness from the JavaDocResearcher which we use all
the time to go from a class or method name to its documentation or source,
through the equivalent RubyResearcher (less useful only because we write
less Ruby) to the ManPageResearcher and NumberResearcher (which shows numbers
in alternative bases, and interpreted as ASCII bytes), which are rarely
useful. The main problem with this system is that it's specific to Edit. It's
not easy to offer the same functionality in other Java programs (though some
refactoring work could fix this), and it's impossible to offer it in non-Java
programs, or programs we don't have the source to. It's not easy to see, for
example, how we'd extend this functionality to the web browser.

<p>My next implementation, Assist, was quite different. It was a stand-alone
program, brought up via hotkey, with a single text field and a couple of
buttons. In its simplest form, it would just pass what you'd typed on to
Google via your default web browser. If it recognized what you'd typed as
being in a special form, though, it would do a more directed search. So a
UK post code would open a <a href="http://www.multimap.com/">Multimap</a> map
of the area, for example. Somehow, though, I kept finding myself just using
Google. 

<p>Most recently, I wrote a plug-in for Apple's
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/addressbook/">Address Book</a>
to show maps for UK addresses. For some reason, the built-in "Map Of"
functionality only works for US addresses. You may have noticed this
functionality keeps cropping up: I think that's because an address is never
the information I want (I haven't written a single letter this century).
What I want is to know where somewhere is, and a picture &ndash; we call them
maps &ndash; is usually the best way to do that. I was struck by the fact
that there's no obvious reason why the only addresses in our address books
are interesting. If anything, you'd expect to be more likely to know how to
get to where the people in your address book live than to some random address
in a web page. How annoying, then, that there's no easy way to go from an
address in a web page to a map. I could write a
<a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2004/06/04/cm_pt2.html">contextual menu plug-in for Mac OS</a>, but that would be Mac OS-specific, and mean
writing another C program; something I've sworn never to do again. It's also
solving a very specific problem. Why aren't I as interested in ISBN numbers,
or Jikes bug numbers, say? Or getting a dictionary definition of a word?
