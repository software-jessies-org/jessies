Use international English spelling.

Use 4-space 'tabs' and K&R (Sun Java) indentation. (That is, follow the rest of the code.)

Use the Log class instead of System.err/System.out; those should be used only while debugging.
On Windows, writing to either can cause the application to hang.
Remember that printStackTrace() implicitly writes to System.err, and use Log or SimpleDialog instead.

No new file formats; we can't keep just inventing random formats left, right and center.
Any file we write (for our own purposes) should use an existing well-known format.
XML may be more work than it ought to be, but it's probably the right choice.

Never use "new File"; use FileUtilities.fileFromString instead; this also understands ~/HACKING and ~elliotth/HACKING.

Cast away Graphics as soon as you can and use "Graphics2D g" instead.
We've been using "oldGraphics" for Graphics instances passed to us.

Avoid FontMetrics.stringWidth because it doesn't work for anti-aliased text.
Don't just sum character widths yourself either (as we currently do all over the place) because that's not necessarily correct.
You need to measure the whole string you're going to paint.
