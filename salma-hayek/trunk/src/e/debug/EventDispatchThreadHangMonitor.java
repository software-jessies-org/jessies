/**
 * Monitors the AWT event dispatch thread for events that take longer than
 * a certain time to be dispatched.
 * 
 * The principle is to record the time at which we start processing an event,
 * and have another thread check frequently to see if we're still processing.
 * If the other thread notices that we've been processing a single event for
 * too long, it prints a stack trace showing what the event dispatch thread
 * is doing, and continues to time it until it finally finishes.
 * 
 * This is useful in determining what code is causing your Java application's
 * GUI to be unresponsive.
